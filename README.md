# fennec
Minimalist compiled programming language (WIP)

Run WIP compiler using `lua fennec.lua <filename>`

Currently only compiles to x86 32-bit assembly, many features are
unimplemented, such as type checking and an equivalent to C header files.

Also is currently untested and probably completely broken, so don't actually use it yet.

Also there is no documentation either.
